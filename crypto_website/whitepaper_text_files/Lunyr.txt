STK GLOBAL PAYMENTS
DECEMBER 2017

WHITEPAPER 1

ABSTRACT
The STK token will enable real time point of sale (POS) transactions directly from users' private cryptocurrency wallets. We predict the ability to make purchases in-store and online using cryptocurrencies will speed up mass adoption of the technology. The STK token is part of a global solution to facilitate borderless transactions. To make instant payments at point of sale from a blockchain wallet requires we do a real-time exchange of cryptocurrency into fiat. The STK token provides access to our state channels which a) ensure there is sufficient cryptocurrency (i.e. Bitcoin, Ether) in the digital wallet and b) users spending fiat at point of sale will complete the purchase from their cryptocurrency assets. STK automatically opens a state channel between each user and STK's own wallet. STK tokens fund the transaction, much like gas funds Ethereum transactions. The first implementation will be with STACK's digital wallet. STK tokens will be implemented on the public Ethereum blockchain and adhere to the ERC20 protocol.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
To date, cryptocurrency has yet to gain mainstream adoption. The last barriers to mass market adoption will be removed when cryptocurrencies become embedded into everyday commerce. An estimated $22 trillion1 of consumer spending takes place annually between shoppers and merchants. Local/national currencies are used to pay for everything from your cup of coffee every morning to your weekly grocery run. What if you could pay for your cup of coffee with Bitcoin or Ether? Without requiring the merchant to change their point of sale equipment, STACK is enabling ubiquitous merchant acceptance of cryptocurrencies. This will greatly accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrency and tapping into the existing ecosystem of global commerce.
VISION
STK Global Payment's vision is to create a globally accessible alternative to traditional banking, allowing you to store your money safely, access it instantly and transact with it anywhere, in any currency including crypto by using the STK token, right from your smartphone, using the STACK app. Creating a digital wallet as a companion to a traditional card solution, the STACK app enables you to use any of your currencies at point of sale, anywhere in the world.
STK WILL BE A PLATFORM THAT WILL FACILITATE REAL-TIME CRYPTOCURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AT POINT OF SALE.

CURRENT LIMITATIONS OF BLOCKCHAIN SETTLEMENT
Because very few merchants accept cryptocurrencies at point of sale or online, consumers must exchange cryptocurrencies into their local currency to make everyday purchases. Through any existing exchanges this can be time consuming, and comes with sizeable fees. Though some companies have made products that enable retailers to accept Bitcoin payments, they are currently available at only a tiny number of locations.
Our goal is for this exchange to occur in real time, anywhere credit cards are accepted, and with fees comparable to transaction costs on Ethereum. At present, the confirmation time for Bitcoin transactions averages 10 minutes2, far too long for point of sale purchases. Ethereum transactions are faster, at an average time of 24 seconds, but even this is too slow for point of sale.3 Furthermore, neither the merchant nor the local currency provider are willing to wait the required amount of time for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain, which is critical to protecting both parties against fraud.
STK SOLUTION: STK STATE CHANNEL AND STK TOKEN
There is a two-pronged problem that the STK solution will solve:
1) A lack of merchant acceptance of cryptocurrency. STACK has partnered with an existing payment network that will allow the cryptocurrency wallet to be used at 39 million merchant locations.4
2) Payments at point-of-sale must complete in near-instant time. Rather than writing each payment transaction to the blockchain, STACK, will create State Channels between the customer and STACK. These channels are an established way to provide real time transaction guarantees on the blockchain. Once this is done, customers' transactions will be funded through STK's liquidity pool to make point of sale purchases instantly.
To use this system, the user is required to hold a STK token which grant access to the STK State Channel and will be limited to those who have STK tokens.

STK IS A SOLUTION THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED GLOBALLY, WITH THE FIRST IMPLEMENTATION OCCURRING WITH STACK
In order for users of the STACK wallet to transact in real-time, the STK solution will be integrated into the STACK digital multi-currency wallet. This functionality can only be accessed with a STK token. The STK token will be used to pay for the operating cost of setting up the State Channel. Because STK tokens can change in value, the price per transaction is calculated similarly to how gas prices are on Ethereum.

STATE CHANNELS
State Channels are a technique for making off-chain transactions with the same security guarantees as an onchain operation. State Channels allow us to conduct blockchain interactions as if they were being conducted on-chain, but require only that two or more users exchange information with each other5. Participants in a State Channel may exchange a large number of transactions between one another instantaneously, requiring an on-chain operation only when the channel is closed. State Channels provide the speed required for STACK's point-of-sale purchase mechanism: at the moment of purchase, the user sends STK tokens to STACK in exchange for STACK using their liquidity pool to make a fiat purchase through the global payment network. This is a cost effective approach to enabling transactions.
HOW DOES THIS WORK IN PRACTICE?
Step-by-step process: 1. Creating a State Channel:
The user loads their STK token into the STACK mobile wallet, which authorizes the creation of a State Channel with the STK platform. Both the user's device and STACK keep a local copy of the current state of the channel. Creation of a state channel requires an on-chain operation.

2. Conducting Transactions and State Changes: When the user initiates a point of sale transaction using STACK, they receive a visual prompt in the STACK wallet showing the value of the transaction, similar to using traditional tap-to-pay mobile applications. Behind the scenes, the user authorizes a transaction to send the equivalent cryptocurrency to the STK platform.
Almost immediately, the STK platform receives the signed transaction, counter-signs and stores a copy of that new state off-chain. STK then authorizes its local currency account to pay the requested purchase through its global payment network rails on behalf of the user. Because the transaction occurs off-chain, there is virtually no delay except for a small amount of computation time and network latency.
3. Keeping Funds Ready: So long as the State Channel is open, there are no fees for conducting any number of transactions between the user and STK. Moreover, there is no fee for keeping the channel open.
4. Withdrawing Funds: If the user wants to retrieve all or part of their STK token in the channel that has not been sent to STK, they can do so by withdrawing their funds. The user signs and publishes a withdrawal request, which requires an on-chain operation. It is possible to make partial withdrawals, so the user is always secure in being able retrieve his or her ether while still keeping the channel open for future transactions with the STK network.
5. Closing: To close a State Channel, one of the parties signs and publishes a close request to the State Channel. This initiates a period during which either party can submit their most recent transactions, which determines the final state of the state channel.
