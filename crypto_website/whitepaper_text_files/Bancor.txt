Abstract
Cindicator creates the social and technological infrastructure needed to make eective decisions under the volatile conditions of the new economy.
By combining a large number of diverse nancial analysts and a set of machinelearning models into a single system, we are developing a Hybrid Intelligence infrastructure for the ecient management of investors' capital in traditional nancial and crypto-markets.
The benets of Hybrid Intelligence for an ecosystem and community are: E a technological and analytical infrastructure for the ecient and safe management of investors' capital by investors themselves or licensed managers; - an opportunity for analysts to monetise their intellectual assets without risking their own funds; - tools and data for making investment decisions under the conditions of market uncertainty; - up-to-date analytics of the industry, expectations, opportunities, and market growth points; - indices and ratings of crypto-assets.

where Epredict is the forested vlue @for ny lgorithmAD Tl = {tk1 . . . tk } is the time series of the tiker lF

uh  lss is lled sustainable under the timing errorF

Theorem 1. Let us assume that µ^( ,  ) is the model class sustainable against
the timing error, Tl is the time series for which Tl > Tl Then:   : S  S is the ane transformation at a set of signals, for which:

lim

|S^l

- Elreal|

=

0,

„‰Â

S^l

=

(Sl),

t



Tl .

Proof. Let us prove that provided that Theorem conditions are met, there exists
an ane transformation , for which |S^l - Elreal| .

Without prejudice to communality, let us assume that all the forecasts are
shifted upward, beyond the real value by   (inferred from the denition of
a sustainable class). The case of downward shifting is proven analogically.

1) Induction Basis. Let us assume that  < is the forecast error for the moment t1 = Tl , then let us set the shift (Sl) = Sl -  as the transformation. We might note that the error for this case will be ^ = 0.
We shall add the forecast with the error  < to the moment t2 = Tl .
Using the previous transformation, we then obtain that the error of the
second forecast became as follows: ^ =  - .

We then see that without the transformation, the total error of two fore-
casts will be  + , and  -  with the transformation.

It is obvious that  -    + , as   0.

2) Induction Step. Let us assume that  = {1 . . .  |i < } denotes errors of forecasts in the time series Tl = {tl1 . . . tl }. Then the value  = i
i
will be the total error in the series Tl .
We shall take the transformation (Sl) = Sl - E[Etpredict - Etreal], where t  Tl .

Let us then add the next forecast with the error  <

t = T l(tau+1)

 l

.

to the moment

Now we must prove that

i

i +   (

i + ) - 2

,

or

i 2 i  0.


IW

As  = 0, while the sustainability conditions provide for i  0, then the
i
monotonicity statement will be correct.

Let us use the Weierstrass Theorem for the limited monotonic sequence:

Any monotonically increasing series, bounded from above (or monotonically decreasing series, bounded from below), has the limit equal to its least upper (lower) bound.

Thus,

we

obtain

that
