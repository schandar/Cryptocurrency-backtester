Executive  Summary  
Qlink  aims  to  build  the  world's  first  decentralized  mobile  network,  which  will  extend   network  coverage,  reduce  the  cost  of  telecom  infrastructures,  and  reward  users  for  sharing   unused  network  assets.  
This  white  paper  explains  the  technical  architecture  of  the  decentralized  mobile  network.     
By  utilizing  blockchain  technology,  Qlink  applies  digital  identities  to  telecom  assets,   repackages  those  assets,  and  records  the  usage  footprint  of  each  asset  to  a  distributed   ledger.  Additionally,  Qlink  aims  to  launch  applications  designed  to  allow  peer--to--peer   sharing  of  assets,  including  Wi--Fi,  mobile  data  access,  and  enterprise--to--peer  SMS.     
While  improving  the  efficiency  of  existing  networks,  Qlink  plans  to  launch  its  custom  base   stations,  including  a  model  suitable  for  vehicle  installation.  By  utilizing  the  idle  resources  of   network  equipment,  these  base  stations  will  allow  users  to  become  a  part  of  the  crypto-- economy,  and  at  the  same  time  create  a  decentralized  solution  to  cover  network  black   spots.     
Qlink  has  assembled  a  team  of  seasoned  telecom  and  blockchain  developers,  along  with   experienced  business  and  marketing  professionals.  Allen  Li,  founder  of  Qlink,  previously   founded  Youyou  Mobile  (invested  by  Alibaba  Capital),  which  is  a  leading  mobile  data   distributor  in  China  and  Southeast  Asia,  and  has  partnered  with  40  telecom  operators   around  the  world  to  provide  mobile  data  services  to  6  million  customers.  Qlink's  R&D  team   has  spent  last  four  years  working  for  Youyou  Mobile,  and  developed  the  company's  first   virtual  SIM  card  bank.  
The  Qlink  ecosystem  is  supported  by  the  Qlink  token  (QLC).  QLC  is  the  utility  token  used  to   settle  every  transaction  on  the  Qlink  network,  functioning  as  a  cryptocurrency  to  measure   the  value  of  assets  and  content.  
Qlink  will  begin  issuing  QIink  tokens  (QLC)  in  November  2017.  Through  the  QLC  token  sale,   Qlink  aims  to  raise  the  equivalent  of  USD$15,000,000  in  ETH  and  NEO.  The  total  supply  of   QLC  is  six  hundred  million  tokens  (600,000,000).

1.  The  Problem  with  Centralized  Telecom  
Operations  
Currently,  more  than  2000  mobile  network  operators  around  the  world  are  providing   communication  services  through  inflexible  centralized  infrastructure.  Common  examples  of   these  centralized  services  include  Wi--Fi,  3G  /  4G  network  facilities  and  mobile   communication  BOSS  solutions  (billing  and  operation  supporting  system),  to  Nasdaq  listed   companies  such  as  Twilio,  who  provide  corporate  SMS  /  voice  /  data  and  other  cloud  based   communication  services.  A  common  business  model  of  these  centralized  mobile  network  
operators  (including  virtual  operators)  is  as  follows:  
  
Unfortunately,  this  widely  adopted  centralized  system  is  largely  inflexible  and  has  many   issues.  These  include  difficulty  in  accurate  content  distribution  and  billing,  expensive  usage   based  fees,  operators  overcharging  customers,  and  security  issues  surrounding  data   transmission.  Unlike  a  centralized  model,  decentralized  communication  infrastructure  and   service  operations  do  not  have  these  problems.  They  solve  these  problems  via  innovative   solutions  based  on  blockchain  technologies.  More  importantly,  from  end--users'  perspective,   this  type  of  decentralized  system  can  protect  user  privacy  in  a  better  way,  while  providing  a   more  flexible  and  affordable  option  to  traditional  service  offerings.   Qlink  is  differentiated  because  it  is  able  to  identify  and  digitize  telecom  assets,  deploy  smart   contracts  and  transfer  asset  usage  rights.  Features  of  blockchain  technology  such  as   asymmetric  encryption,  distributed  ledger  and  consensus  algorithm  allow  Qlink  to  assign   ownership  of  digital  assets  to  users  by  utilizing  secure  digital  identity.  Qlink  will  also  enable   the  deployment  of  smart  contracts  between  telecom  assets  and  users,  which  will  allow  users   to  purchase  usage  right  of  assets  such  as  Wi--Fi  hotspots,  SMS  packages  or  mobile  data,   directly  from  an  asset  sharer,  rather  than  through  a  centralized  mobile  operator.

2.  Qlink  Platform  
Qlink's  decentralized  network  provides  telecom  service  through  an  ecosystem  comprised  of   telecom  assets,  the  Public  Chain,  the  Qlink  Chain,  smart  contracts,  mobile  operators,  content   providers  and  users.   Definitions:  
Telecom  Service:  A  telecom  service  is  a  service  used  to  access,  accept,  transmit  and   deliver  information  of  content  from  one  point  to  another,  such  as  Wi--Fi  access,  
mobile  data  access,  SMS,  voice,  quality  of  service,  or  virtual  private  network.        
Telecom  Asset:  A  telecom  asset  is  broadly  defined  as  a  telecom  service,  which  is   owned  by  users  or  carriers.  Examples  of  telecom  assets  are  Wi--Fi  hotspots,  SMS   packages,  mobile  data,  or  hardware  used  to  create  network  coverage,  such  as  a   router  or  base  station.   Qlink  provides  telecom  services  through  the  Qlink  network.  By  utilizing  blockchain   technology,  Qlink  is  able  to  transfer  QLC  tokens  whilst  delivering  telecom  services,  making  it   possible  to  generate  a  ledger  of  all  completed  telecom  service  transactions.   Qlink  also  allows  a  variety  of  telecom  assets  to  be  registered,  authenticated  and  traded  on   the  Public  Chain  and  Qlink  Chain.  Qlink  will  allow  asset  owners  to  register  their  rights  to   access  certain  telecom  assets  on  the  Qlink  platform.  The  owners  can  then  share  and  transfer   the  usage  rights  to  other  users  through  smart  contracts.  By  sharing  telecom  assets  on  Qlink,   owners  can  collect  rewards  in  the  form  of  QLC  tokens.  
2.1.  Network  Structure  
Qlink  has  designed  its  technology  architecture  based  on  business  logic.  The  network  is   comprised  of  various  functional  modules.           
5  

  
Blockchain  
The  network  core  layer  is  blockchain,  which  includes  both  the  Public  Chain  and  the  Qlink   Chain.  
The  Public  Chain  will  be  used  to  register  telecom  assets  and  assign  them  a  digital  identity.   Digital  identity  is  the  unique  information  used  to  represent  a  telecom  asset  an  on  Qlink   network.  Once  this  information  is  generated  it  cannot  be  changed.  Qlink  uses  the  NEO   blockchain  for  telecom  asset  registration.  
The  Qlink  Chain  has  two  primary  functions.  Firstly,  it  keeps  a  record  of  transactions  between   asset  owners  and  users  on  a  ledger,  and  secondly,  it  deploys  and  executes  smart  contracts.  
A  Qlink  smart  contract  is  an  algorithmic  contract  deployed  between  users  and  telecom   assets,  establishing  trading  rules  and  automatically  executing  transactions  through  code.  
For  example,  Anna  wants  to  access  her  neighbor's  Wi--Fi,  and  agrees  to  pay  a  QLC  reward  to   the  Wi--Fi  owner  based  on  the  length  of  time  she  is  connected.  These  trading  terms  will  be   written  into  a  smart  contract  and  are  then  executed  automatically  through  the  Qlink   platform  without  any  manual  intervention.  
Qlink  Gateway  
The  Qlink  Gateway  is  the  protocol  that  connects  Qlink  users  with  global  operators,  allowing   the  user  direct  access  to  mobile  data  and  the  freedom  to  create  customized  service   packages  through  the  deployment  of  smart  contracts.  
Applications     
Qlink's  decentralized  framework  will  enable  the  development  of  various  new  services.  
6  

Qlink  will  provide  the  following  service  applications  through  the  Qlink  app  --  
 Wi--Fi  sharing    Mobile  data  access  &  content  distribution    Enterprise--to--peer  SMS  service  
   Qlink  will  open  up  the  Qlink  Chain  API  to  allow  developers  to  build  their  own  service  
applications.  
  
Qlink  will  provide  two  apps  to  interface  with  these  service  applications  --  
1. The  Qlink  mobile  app,  which  allows  users  to  connect  to  Wi--Fi  hotspots,  access   mobile  data  and  view  registered  content.  It  can  also  be  used  to  register  telecom   assets,  such  as  a  Wi--Fi  hotspot,  and  register  unused  SMS  on  the  E2P  SMS  platform  to   earn  QLC  tokens.     
2. The  Qlink  desktop  app,  which  will  offer  most  of  the  same  features  found  in  the  Qlink   mobile  app.  However,  the  desktop  app  will  allow  for  the  purchase,  instead  of   registration,  of  unused  E2P  SMS,  and  allow  the  user  to  register  and  distribute   content  through  Qlink.  
   Qlink  allows  content  creators  such  as  advertisers,  video  providers,  and  copyright  holders  to   register  content  on  the  Qlink  platform.  The  content  can  then  be  distributed  to  users  on  the   Qlink  network  through  the  Qlink  app,  without  the  user  incurring  the  cost  of  data.  
Distributed  network  infrastructure  
Qlink  will  launch  the  Qlink  BaseStation  that  will  provide  mobile  data  and  Wi--Fi  access,  and   also  features  mining  capability.  The  deployment  of  Qlink  BaseStations  will  create  a   decentralized  infrastructure  that  will  complement  the  existing  network,  whilst  providing   additional  coverage  of  black  spots  through  solutions  such  as  vehicle  fitted  base  stations.  The   Qlink  BaseStation's  mining  capability  will  make  use  of  idle  telecom  network  resources  to  
maintain  the  distributed  ledger  and  secure  the  Qlink  network.  
2.2.  Qlink  Proprietary  Technology  
Qlink  Chain  
The  Qlink  Chain  is  being  developed  specifically  for  the  telecommunication  industry,  based  on   the  industry's  unique  requirements.  The  Public  Chain  supports  the  registration  of   telecommunication  infrastructure  as  digital  assets  in  various  scenarios,  whilst  the  Qlink   Chain  provides  billing  and  operational  support.  
7  

The  Qlink  Chain  contains  --  
 Digital  content:  Fingerprints  of  digital  content  registered  by  content  creators  or  IP   owners  
 Data  traffic  billing  information:  Billing  information  based  on  users'  data  usage  on  the   Qlink  network  
 Users  visit  records:  Encrypted  records  of  users'  browsing  history      To  accommodate  the  requirements  of  the  mobile  network  business,  the  Qlink  Chain  will   adopt  a  Delegated  Proof--of--Stake  (DPOS)  consensus  algorithm  to  generate  billing  data  and   create  a  ledger  of  content  accessed  by  users.  This  algorithm  supports  high  frequency  and   concurrent  transactions  with  low  fees.  Qlink  users  will  be  able  to  deploy  smart  contracts   seamlessly  between  telcos,  content  producers,  IoT  terminals  and  enterprises.  
Qlink  Gateway  
Qlink  will  establish  the  Qlink  Gateway  --  a  platform  that  connects  the  Qlink  blockchain  to   traditional  telecom  operator  systems.  This  will  allow  users  to  gain  direct  access  to  global   operator  data  services  through  the  deployment  of  smart  contracts.  
Smart  contracts  created  on  the  Qlink  Gateway  to  support  data  clearance  between  content   providers  and  mobile  operators  function  as  follows:  
 A  smart  contract  guarantees  the  terms  of  a  mobile  data  service  agreement.  For   example,  if  a  content  provider  would  like  to  purchase  data  to  distribute  a  movie   through  the  Qlink  network,  the  data  allocation  and  billing  terms  will  be  written  onto   the  Qlink  Chain  as  a  smart  contract.  The  smart  contract  will  then  be  deployed   between  the  Qlink  Chain  and  the  Gateway,  and  will  remain  fixed  until  a  new   contract  is  created.     
 Smart  contracts  guarantee  that  a  service  agreement  will  be  executed  successfully.   When  a  user  successfully  gains  access  to  a  service  as  defined  by  a  smart  contract,   the  user  account  will  send  a  transaction  message  to  the  contract  to  trigger  a   fulfillment  action,  which  will  then  transfer  payment  in  QLC  tokens  to  the  mobile   operator.     
Meanwhile,  the  smart  contract  will  also  broadcast  the  transaction  information  to  the   Qlink  network  for  the  miners  to  confirm  and  record  to  the  Qlink  Chain.  
Qlink's  smart  contracts  are  open  source  and  will  be  publicly  available  in  Qlink's   GitHub  repository.  A  smart  contract  will  not  be  subject  to  the  control  of  any   individual  node  once  it  has  been  written  to  the  Qlink  Chain.  In  order  to  change  smart   contract  code,  the  changes  must  be  supported  by  the  community  as  a  whole,   therefore  ensuring  fairness  and  transparency.

Fiat  Integration  and  QLC  Clearance  
In  consideration  of  traditional  business  practices,  Qlink  offers  a  few  additional  features  for   the  convenience  of  users.  For  example,  Qlink  will  also  enable  the  purchase  of  mobile  data  in   fiat.  If  the  user  chooses  to  buy  mobile  data  with  fiat,  it  will  not  be  executed  as  a  smart   contract  on  the  Qlink  Chain.  Qlink  will  process  the  transaction  in  the  same  manner  as  a   traditional  data  reseller.  This  option  is  provided  to  allow  customers  time  to  gradually  adopt   the  use  of  QLC.   To  encourage  mobile  operators  to  provide  services  through  Qlink,  the  Gateway  will  also   provide  QLC  to  fiat  clearance.  When  a  content  provider  purchases  mobile  data  through  QLC,   the  Qlink  Gateway  will  provide  an  option  to  exchange  QLC  to  fiat  currency,  based  on  market   rate,  and  act  like  a  clearance  agent  for  the  transaction.  This  provides  an  easy  on  ramp  for   operators  who  are  not  ready  to  settle  transactions  in  cryptocurrency,  but  still  allows  for  the   deployment  of  smart  contracts.

The  Qlink  team  is  working  closely  with  NEO,  the  largest  open  source  blockchain  community   in  China,  to  conduct  interoperation  with  NEO's  public  blockchain  through  a  cross--chain   protocol.  The  Qlink  Chain  and  NEO  blockchain  will  communicate  to  synchronize  the   registration  of  telecommunication  infrastructures  as  digital  assets,  while  at  the  same  time   providing  billing  and  operational  support  on  a  case--by--case  basis.   Wi--Fi  networks,  Qlink  BaseStations,  and  future  operator  base  stations  will  all  be  registered   on  the  NEO  blockchain.   The  cross--chain  protocol  between  the  Qlink  and  NEO  blockchains  is  executed  based  on   physical  asset  mapping.  A  reliable  link  is  established  between  Qlink  and  NEO  by  Coin  Packet   message  delivery.   Please  refer  to  the  process  outlined  in  the  below  graphic:

3.  Applications  
Qlink  will  set  up  an  open  network,  which  will  support  a  variety  of  applications.  Some   examples  are  as  follows  --  
Wi--Fi  Access  /  Data  Access  +  Content  Distribution  
Qlink  will  establish  a  decentralized  global  Wi--Fi  sharing  network  with  P2P  login.  Prior  to  the   launch  of  the  Qlink  Chain,  P2P  login  will  be  authenticated  on  the  Public  Chain  and  use  a   Delegated  Byzantine  Fault  Tolerance  (dBFT)  consensus  algorithm.     
Once  the  Qlink  Chain  has  been  launched,  registration  of  Wi--Fi  assets  will  remain  on  the  Public   Chain,  however  the  authentication  of  P2P  login  will  move  to  the  Qlink  Chain  and  utilize  a   Proof--of--Stake  consensus  mechanism.     
By  enforcing  encrypted  P2P  distribution  of  login  information  we  can  ensure  stronger  security   for  the  public  Wi--Fi  network.  
Qlink  will  also  support  mobile  data  access  and  content  distribution,  allowing  for  content  access   through  a  P2P  connection.     
This  will  enable  business  use  cases  such  as  --  
 Content  producers  or  advertisers  can  distribute  content  through  the  purchase  of   prepaid  mobile  data  packages  with  byte  by  byte  accuracy.  For  example,  a  movie  studio   may  purchase  100GB  of  mobile  data  to  distribute  a  movie  trailer  to  fans,  which  can   then  be  accessed  without  the  user  incurring  the  cost  of  the  data  transfer.        
 Mobile  access  and  data  usage  can  be  provided  to  IoT  suppliers.  For  example,  a  courier   company  could  install  Qlink  BaseStations  on  vehicles  to  transmit  operational  data  to   those  who  have  access.  Qlink's  ability  to  bill  this  data  on  micro--level  is  a  critical   advantage.  
E2P  SMS  service  on  decentralized  network  
Qlink  will  allow  users  to  sell  unused  SMS  to  enterprise  customers  for  the  purpose  of   registration  codes,  one--time  dynamic  passwords,  verification  codes,  marketing  messages  and  
other  direct  messaging  communications.     
Crowdsourcing  telecom  infrastructure  
All  users  can  deploy  their  own  Qlink  BaseStation  on  LTE--U  protocol  without  worrying  about   spectrum  resources.  The  Qlink  BaseStation  will  support  3GPP  LTE--U  and  OpenBTS  SIP  
11  

communication  protocol  framework.  The  Qlink  BaseStation  is  also  a  miner  that  supports   Proof--of--Work  and  Proof--of--Stake  consensus  algorithms,  allowing  users  to  contribute  hash   power  to  secure  the  Qlink  Chain.  Essentially,  the  network  is  built  and  secured  by  the  users.   This  network  structure  is  a  perfect  solution  to  the  tide  phenomenon  of  telecom  usage.  It  is   also  the  first  system  that  combines  base  station  technology  with  mining  hardware,  utilizing  a  
consensus  algorithm  to  ensure  the  resiliency  of  the  Qlink  Chain.  
3.1.  Decentralized  Wi--Fi  Sharing  
Wi--Fi  sharing  is  a  massive  global  market.  There  are  approximately  300  million  users   accessing  the  internet  through  shared  Wi--Fi  in  China  alone.  
The  problem  with  the  current  Wi--Fi  sharing  model  
Wi--Fi  is  still  one  of  the  most  popular  network  choices  for  indoor  mobile  phone  users,  even  in   the  5G  era,  and  is  an  important  supplement  to  existing  mobile  networks.  There  are  currently   roughly  300  million  Wi--Fi  hotspots  around  the  world.  The  top  five  countries  by  volume  are  as  
follows:  

Country   France

Wi--Fi  Hotspots   13,096,824   9,858,246   5,611,944   4,910,368   3,303,459  

Ranking   1   2   3   4   5  

The  current  global  Wi--Fi  hotspot  coverage  is  extremely  fragmented.  The  world's  largest  Wi--Fi   sharing  platform  has  300  million  active  users  and  is  built  on  a  centralized  network  that   grants  access  to  a  large  number  of  Wi--Fi  hotspots  in  retail  spaces,  homes,  and  workplaces.   This  company  is  valued  at  USD$5  billion.  However,  there  are  many  flaws  in  this  centralized  
Wi--Fi  sharing  model:  
 Centralized  Wi--Fi  sharing  companies  often  transfer  user's  Wi--Fi  passwords  without   permission,  or  even  encourage  Wi--Fi  freeloading  activities.     
 Centralized  platforms  profit  through  Wi--Fi  key  transmission  and  targeted   advertising,  but  the  network  sharers  do  not  receive  any  rewards.     
12  

 Frequent  password  modifications  severely  reduce  the  accessibility  of  Wi--Fi  hotspots.     
 This  system  is  unable  to  accurately  or  directly  charge  the  user  on  the  amount  of  data   consumed.     
 These  issues  make  life  difficult  for  Wi--Fi  sharers,  which  has  a  flow  on  effect  in   reducing  the  number  and  availability  of  Wi--Fi  hotspots.     
Despite  these  challenges,  global  mobile  network  operators  are  investing  heavily  in  building   up  their  Wi--Fi  coverage,  while  continually  expanding  their  mobile  network  coverage  across   not  only  their  native  countries,  but  the  whole  world.  Wi--Fi  networks  can  greatly  reduce  the   mobile  network  telecom  load  during  peak  hours.  However,  the  operating  systems  currently   used  by  existing  mobile  operators  are  not  compatible  with  Wi--Fi  networks.  To  access  the   internet,  customers  are  required  to  use  their  mobile  phone  number  to  receive  a  temporary   password  from  their  network  operator.  This  Wi--Fi  login  mechanism  is  too  complicated  and   often  leads  to  unstable,  slow  and  fractured  service  which  hurts  the  user  experience.  
Qlink  addresses  these  issues  by  building  a  network  based  on  blockchain  technology.  This  will   provide  better  service  for  Wi--Fi  users,  and  better  privacy  protection  for  Wi--Fi  sharers.  
Implementation  of  decentralized  Wi--Fi  sharing  (For  sharers)  
1. Qlink  will  enable  the  registration  of  Wi--Fi  hotspots  through  the  Qlink  app  as  a  digital   asset  on  the  Public  Chain.  This  will  allow  Wi--Fi  sharers  to  receive  QLC  tokens  as   payment  for  allowing  access  to  the  hotspot  through  the  execution  of  a  smart   contract.     
2. Qlink  will  support  the  P2P  transmission  of  passwords  between  Wi--Fi  hotspot  sharers   and  Wi--Fi  network  users,  ensuring  that  Wi--Fi  passwords  are  securely  transferred   from  one  party  to  another.  
3. Qlink  will  support  the  authentication  of  Wi--Fi  keys  through  the  blockchain  consensus   mechanism.  If  a  registered  Wi--Fi  hotspot,  password,  or  SSID  configuration  has   changed,  the  asset  will  need  to  be  re--registered  on  the  Public  Chain  (with  at  least  6   confirmations),  and  new  passwords  will  need  to  be  broadcast.  
Implementation  of  decentralized  Wi--Fi  sharing  (For  users)  
1. When  a  Qlink  user  shares  a  new  Wi--Fi  hotspot  for  the  first  time,  it  will  be  registered   as  a  digital  asset  by  Qlink  on  the  Public  Chain.  Registration  information  will  include   the  GPS  address  of  the  Wi--Fi  hotspot,  IP  address,  MAC  address,  internet  speed  test   report,  SSID,  and  other  associated  information.  Encrypted  password  will  kept  to  Wi--

Fi  with  sharer  not  on  Public  Chain.      2. Once  a  new  Wi--Fi  hotspot  has  been  successfully  registered  on  the  Qlink  Chain,  the   Wi--Fi  will  become  available  to  all  Qlink  users.      3. Users  can  log  in  to  the  Qlink  app  to  find  a  list  of  nearby  Wi--Fi  hotspots  based  on  GPS   data.      4. Users  can  gain  access  to  a  Wi--Fi  hotspot  after  Wi--Fi  sharer  authorize  the  connection   and  Qlink  wiill  support  P2P  transmission  of  passwords  between  Wi--Fi  hotspot  sharers   and   Wi--Fi   network   users.   If   sharing   of   Wi--Fi   requires   QLC,   a   smart   contract   will   be   transferring  a  certain  number  of  QLC  tokens  to  Wi--Fi  sharer,  determined  by  the  Wi--Fi   sharer's  settings.      5. The  Qlink  app  will  automatically  use  this  password  to  login  to  the  Wi--Fi  hotspot.        
   Wi--Fi  Sharing  of  user--direct--pay  model  
Token  usage  and  Wi--Fi  billing  
QLC  tokens  will  be  used  to  pay  for  access  to  Wi--Fi  hotspots.  Wi--Fi  owners  can  create  a  smart   contract  that  charges  a  fee  in  QLC  to  users  who  would  like  access  to  the  connection.  In  this   instance,  the  contract  will  start  billing  from  the  moment  the  users  connect  to  the  Wi--Fi   hotspot,  and  cease  when  the  users  disconnect.   Alternatively,  the  hotspot  owner  may  choose  to  provide  free  Wi--Fi  and  simply  accept   voluntary  QLC  donations.  Wi--Fi  owners  also  have  the  option  to  incorporate  advertising  or   content  distribution  as  another  way  to  monetize  their  connection  and  still  provide  a  free  Wi-- Fi  service.

   Wi--Fi  Sharing  of  content  distribution  model  
3.2.  Mobile  Data  and  Content  Distribution  
The  process  of  gaining  access  to  mobile  data  on  Qlink  is  very  similar  to  the  process  used  to   gain  Wi--Fi  access.  The  main  difference,  however,  is  that  pre--paid  mobile  data  packages  must   be  purchased,  with  data  being  consumed  as  the  user  connects  to  the  internet.  This  enables  
Qlink  to  provide  mobile  data  access  on  a  very  flexible  billing  model.     
  
The  market  for  decentralized  mobile  data  distribution  
In  recent  years,  global  network  operators  have  spent  between  USD$10  to  $15  billion   annually  on  Billing  and  Operation  Supporting  Systems  (BOSS).  With  the  emergence  of  the   Internet  of  Things  (IoT),  Ericsson  has  predicted  that  by  2020,  IoT  devices  connected  to  
15  

mobile  networks  and  Wi--Fi  will  reach  1.5  billion,  whilst  the  total  number  of  IoT  devices  is   expected  to  reach  25  billion.      In  an  increasingly  connected  world,  BOSS  solutions  need  to  support  secure  digital  identity  of   IoT  devices,  as  well  as  have  the  capability  to  converge  insurance,  legal  services,  and  other   associated  billing  services,  which  all  require  smart  contracts.  Current  BOSS  solutions   employed  by  traditional  mobile  network  operators  do  not  support  the  deployment  of  smart   contracts.   Qlink's  decentralized  network,  on  the  other  hand,  is  a  BOSS  that  will  allow  users  to   seamlessly  deploy  smart  contracts  among  network  operators,  content  providers,  IoT  devices,   and  corporate  users.  It  will  give  users  the  flexibility  to  customize  their  own  packages,  as  well   as  the  capability  to  accurately  distribute  large  amounts  of  content.  The  Qlink  platform  will   support  customizable  data  usage  billing  in  any  given  scenario,  meaning  operator  to  user,   user  to  user,  and  IoT  billing  are  all  possible  on  the  Qlink  platform.  
In  short,  Qlink  will  enable:  
 A  mobile  data  distribution  platform  for  content  providers,  which  further  reduces  the   cost  of  content  consumption  and  will  change  the  expensive  online  promotion  model.  
 The  deployment  of  smart  contracts  for  IoT,  and  the  provision  of  billing  and   management  service  for  IoT  based  companies.  
Mobile  content  distribution  on  the  decentralized  network  
  
In  addition  to  users  paying  tokens  to  access  Wi--Fi  or  mobile  data,  Qlink  also  enables   advertisers  to  pay  for  network  access.   Content  consumption  is  a  big  part  of  online  activity.  When  users  are  connected  to  the   internet,  they  tend  to  engage  with  content  consuming  activities  such  as  reading  social  media  
16  

feeds,  scanning  through  Twitter,  chatting  with  friends,  shopping,  watching  movies,  reading   books,  and  a  whole  host  of  other  recreational  activities.  When  using  mobile  data,  since   content  platforms  cannot  offer  free  data,  users  may  choose  to  wait  until  they  find  a  Wi--Fi   hotspot,  or  opt  against  using  the  service  entirely.  Qlink  provides  a  solution  that  will  allow   content  providers  to  prepay  for  data  usage,  enabling  users  to  consume  select  content  in   non--Wi--Fi  environments  without  worrying  about  mobile  data  cost.  
Traditional  mobile  network  operating  systems  are  outdated  and  cannot  precisely  pinpoint  a   user's  content  consumption  activities.  Therefore,  they  cannot  provide  customized  content-- based  service  or  billing.  Qlink  is  able  to  certify  the  uniqueness  of  content,  which  as  a  result   makes  customized  content  distribution  plans  possible.  Operators  can  participate  in  the   transaction  of  content  to  boost  their  overall  revenue,  content  providers  benefit  from   accurate  distribution,  and  users  can  enjoy  free  access  to  sponsored  content.  In  this  way,   Qlink  will  generate  new  business  opportunities  and  completely  change  the  traditional   subscription  or  advertisement  based  business  model.  
Qlink  connects  the  following  three  parties  --  
 The  content  provider:  The  content  producer  or  owner,  such  as  a  content  library,   who  registers  their  content  on  Qlink.  
 Mobile  data  provider:  The  recharge  platform  managed  by  a  network  operator,  who   sells  data  packages  through  Qlink.  
 Content  users  &  sharers:  Qlink  users  who  consume  content  on  Qlink,  or  who   transfer/share  their  unused  data  to  others.  
Content  providers  can  register  their  content  on  Qlink  and  then  purchase  mobile  data   according  to  file  size  and  the  size  of  the  audience  they  aim  to  reach.  For  example,  the  trailer   of  Kingsman  is  roughly  3  minutes  long  and  20MB  in  size.  The  content  provider  could   purchase  500GB  of  data  and  then  share  the  trailer  with  their  targeted  audience.  The   audience  would  then  be  able  to  watch  the  trailer  without  using  any  of  their  own  monthly   mobile  data.  
Another  user  could  be  a  company  who  needs  to  share  internal  training  videos  with  their   staff.  The  company  could  pre--purchase  data  and  distribute  the  videos  through  Qlink,  which   would  allow  employees  to  access  videos  on  or  off  site,  without  needing  to  worry  about   connecting  to  Wi--Fi  or  using  their  personal  data.  
Additionally,  mobile  network  operators  in  any  country  will  be  able  to  accurately  sell  data  to   content  providers  and  users  through  Qlink.  Users  can  access,  share  or  even  sponsor  other   users  to  access  content.  In  short,  the  Qlink  platform  will  offer  any  party  the  freedom  to  
define  their  data  needs  and  purchase  fragmented  data  accordingly.  
17  

Distribution  mechanism  
  
Content  registration  
Content  can  be  registered  by  any  user,  regardless  of  whether  they  are  an  individual  user,  IP   owner  or  otherwise.  When  a  user  wants  to  share  content  through  Qlink,  they  simply  register   it  on  Qlink  and  pay  a  fee  in  QLC.  Qlink  will  then  generate  a  hash  signature  for  the  content   and  record  it  to  the  blockchain.  Due  to  the  collision  resistance  of  hash  functions,  it  is  hard  to   find  two  inputs  that  hash  to  the  same  output.  Therefore,  by  comparing  hash  signatures  we   can  pin  down  specific  content  accurately.  
Registering  content  on  Qlink  serves  two  purposes:        
1. Duplicate  content  can  be  identified  and  the  owner  of  the  original  file  will  be  directly   rewarded.     
2. As  each  hash  signature  is  unique,  the  full  history  of  a  user's  content  consumption   can  be  recorded.  
Content  consumption  
Users  will  be  able  to  enjoy  content  through  the  Qlink  platform  at  a  low  cost,  or  even  for  free.   If  the  content  is  sponsored  by  a  content  provider,  the  user  may  even  be  rewarded  for   viewing  the  content  with  QLC.   When  a  user  first  accesses  content,  Qlink  will  generate  a  hash  signature  for  that  content.  By   matching  the  hash  signature  generated  when  the  content  was  registered  by  the  owner  on   Qlink  with  the  hash  signature  generated  upon  the  content  being  accessed,  Qlink  can  track   the  consumption  history  of  specific  content  and  generate  accurate  billing  information.   Through  Qlink,  users  can  access  their  own  content  consumption  records  anytime,  anywhere.   Importantly,  this  evolution  to  a  more  decentralized  bill  management  model  will  reduce  the   risk  of  data  contamination  on  all  fronts.

The  internal  billing  systems  of  mobile  data  providers  can  be  integrated  with  the  Qlink   platform  through  the  Qlink  Chain  API.  By  comparing  the  hash  signatures  of  viewed  content   with  the  hash  signatures  of  registered  content,  the  mobile  data  provider  can  measure   precise  data  usage  of  consumed  content  for  more  accurate  billing  or  to  support  content   based  promotions.  
Token  usage  and  data  usage  
The  QLC  token  functions  as  both  a  reward  for  advertisers  to  incentivize  user  interaction  and   as  a  running  meter  to  record  the  data  usage  on  Qlink  Chain.  
There  is  a  dynamic  ratio  set  up  between  the  number  of  QLC  and  the  amount  of  data   purchased  for  content  distribution.  For  example,  a  video  producer  might  have  a  10MB  movie   they  would  like  to  distribute  to  10  people,  which  requires  a  total  of  100MB  of  data.  They  also   might  choose  to  set  a  total  reward  of  1  QLC  to  incentivize  viewing,  which  will  then  be  divided   by  the  total  amount  of  data  required.  As  each  user  accesses  the  movie,  they  will  receive  a   reward  of  0.1  QLC,  (1  QLC  x  (10MB  /  100MB)).  If  0.7  QLC  has  been  distributed,  the  ledger  will   show  that  70MB  of  data  has  been  used.  When  all  10  users  have  watched  the  video,  the  total   of  1  QLC  will  have  been  distributed  and  the  ledger  will  show  that  100MB  of  data  has  been   used.  
By  recording  this  dynamic  ratio  between  QLC  and  bytes,  according  to  the  number  of  QLC   tokens  transferred,  we  can  ensure  that  accurate  consumption  of  data  is  calculated.  
Qlink  will  also  support  the  purchase  of  mobile  data  in  fiat.  If  the  user  chooses  to  buy  mobile   data  with  fiat,  it  will  not  be  executed  as  a  smart  contract  on  the  Qlink  Chain.  This  option  is   provided  as  an  additional  convenience  for  users  to  encourage  gradual  adoption  of  QLC.  
The  Qlink  Gateway  will  also  provide  QLC  to  fiat  clearance  for  mobile  operators.  When  a   content  provider  purchases  mobile  data  through  QLC,  the  Qlink  Gateway  will  provide  an   option  for  the  operator  to  exchange  QLC  to  fiat  currency,  based  on  market  rate,  and  act  like   a  clearance  agent  for  the  transaction.  
3.3.  Decentralized  E2P  SMS  Service  
Every  day  we  receive  various  text  messages  (SMS)  sent  to  us  by  businesses,  such  as   registration  codes,  one--time  dynamic  passwords,  verification  codes,  or  marketing  messages.  
Examples  of  types  of  companies  that  use  enterprise--to--peer  (E2P)  SMS  to  communicate  with  
customers  are  --

Decentralized  E2P  workflow  
Request  and  fulfillment  of  E2P  SMS     
Using  the  Qlink  desktop  app,  any  company  that  utilizes  E2P  SMS  and  wishes  to  purchase  a   package  can  submit  a  SMS  request  including  details  such  as  quantity,  content  and  price  per   SMS,  all  of  which  will  be  written  into  a  smart  contract.   The  Qlink  network  will  then  broadcast  the  request  to  all  potential  SMS  contributors.  SMS   contributors  can  compare  their  own  offering  with  the  details  in  the  smart  contract  and,  if  it   matches  the  request,  agree  to  the  smart  contract.   The  acceptance  will  then  be  broadcast  back  to  the  Qlink  Chain  where  the  transaction  will  be   processed  and  recorded  to  the  blockchain.  Finally,  completion  of  transaction  will  be   broadcast  to  the  Qlink  network.   In  the  event  that  an  SMS  contributor  is  not  able  to  fulfill  an  order,  for  example,  if  the   contributor  does  not  have  a  data  connection  or  their  device  is  off,  the  Qlink  Chain  will   rebroadcast  the  unfulfilled  SMS  request  back  to  all  potential  SMS  contributors.  A  new  SMS   contributor  will  be  matched  to  fulfill  the  order.   Qlink's  E2P  SMS  service  enables  the  purchase  and  distribution  of  SMS  internationally.  For   example,  a  user  from  Australia  could  find  an  SMS  contributor  from  China  to  distribute  SMS   messages  to  their  Chinese  customers.

Token  usage  and  E2P  SMS  billing  
QLC  tokens  are  paid  by  E2P  senders  to  SMS  contributors  upon  acceptance  of  a  smart   contract.  The  QLC  charge  for  SMS  packages  will  depend  on  the  availability  and  market  rate.  
E2P  SMS  service  launch  plan  
Qlink  will  first  roll  out  the  E2P  SMS  service  to  Android  users,  whilst  the  iOS  version  is   undergoing  research  and  development.

4.  Hardware  
A  base  station  is  a  device  that  sends  and  receives  signals,  serving  as  a  fixed  point  of   communication  for  a  wireless  network,  and  may  also  act  as  a  gateway  between  a  wired   network  and  a  wireless  network.  Examples  of  base  stations  include  home  routers  and  radio  
receiver/transmitters.  
4.1.  Qlink  BaseStation  
The  Qlink  BaseStation  is  hardware  that  will  allow  Qlink  to  expand  the  existing  network  and   cover  black  spots  in  a  decentralized  manner.  The  Qlink  BaseStation  is  an  integrated   hardware  device  that  supports  LTE--U  and  OpenBTS  architecture.  Other  Qlink  BaseStation   functions  include  the  support  of  Wi--Fi  hotspots,  and  support  of  both  Proof  of  Work  (PoW)   and  Proof  of  State  (PoS)  consensus  algorithms  through  the  inclusion  of  mining  hardware.   The  Qlink  BaseStation  is  currently  undergoing  research  and  development  and  will  be   released  after  the  launch  of  the  Qlink  Chain.  
Qlink  BaseStation  Specifications:  
  
1. Chip  Configuration:  FSM9016   2. Cell  Capacity:  8--10  users   3. Power:  100mW   4. Modulation:  LTE/Wi--Fi   5. Coverage  radius:  Maximum  300m  
The  Qlink  BaseStation  adopts  a  CPU+DSP  architecture,  serving  as  a  full  node  and  keeping  a   ledger  of  all  assets  registered  on  the  Qlink  Chain,  deploying  smart  contracts  on  Qlink,  and   configuring  the  Qlink  Gateway  to  global  operators.  At  the  same  time,  the  Qlink  BaseStation   is  able  to  provide  hash  power  to  the  Qlink  Chain  through  the  PoW  and  PoS  consensus  
mechanism  and  contribute  to  a  mining  pool.  
4.2.  Wi--Fi  and  Mobile  Data  Access  
The  Qlink  BaseStation  can  be  used  as  a  home  router  for  Wi--Fi  coverage  or  as  a  portable   device  for  4G  coverage.  Qlink  users  will  register  their  Qlink  BaseStation  on  the  Public  Chain   as  standard  procedure,  recording  the  static  configuration  of  the  device.  Qlink  BaseStation   owners  can  then  set  a  general  billing  policy  for  Wi--Fi  sharing  and  mobile  data  access  by   deploying  a  smart  contract.  When  Qlink  users  access  network  coverage  through  these   BaseStations,  the  smart  contract  will  execute  the  policy  and  will  transfer  the  determined   amount  of  QLC  tokens  from  the  user  to  the  BaseStation  owner.  Qlink  uses  blockchain  
technology  to  authenticate  all  assets  and  transactions  and  avoid  incorrect  billing.

4.3.  Mining  
The  Qlink  BaseStation  is  equipped  with  1GHz  CPU  and  512MB  ROM,  and  supports  Delegated   Proof--of--Stake  mining,  which  is  less  dependent  on  electricity  consumption.  The  Qlink   BaseStation  will  have  the  ability  to  contribute  hash  power  to  the  network,  especially  when   users  are  away  from  the  device.  For  example,  a  home  router  or  BaseStation  could  be  idle  for   80%--90%  of  a  night,  or  during  the  day  whilst  the  user  is  at  work.  In  events  like  these,  the  
Qlink  BaseStation  can  --  
1. Function  as  full  node  for  the  Qlink  Chain,  working  with  other  Qlink  BaseStations,  to   enhance  the  security  of  the  Qlink  Network.     
2. Contribute  computing  power  to  the  Qlink  Chain  or  selected  public  chains  that   support  Proof--of--Stake  or  Proof--Of--Work  algorithm  mining.  Qlink  can  deploy   protocol  to  form  a  mining  pool  for  all  the  Qlink  BaseStations  supporting  the  same   algorithm  and  distribute  the  mining  profits  between  Qlink  BaseStation  owners  and   mining  pool  operators.  
23  

  
The  Qlink  BaseStation  with  LTE--U  protocol  can  be  used  for  PoW  and  PoS  consensus  mining.  [Example  image.  The  
final  product  may  vary]

5.  Development  Roadmap     
There  are  three  main  development  phases  on  the  path  to  launching  the  Qlink  network.  
(Marketing  plan  is  not  included  in  this  timeline.)   Phase  One  --  End  of  Q1  2018  
Qlink  will  develop  the  Wi--Fi  sharing  protocol  and  E2P  SMS  application  and  deploy  to  the   Public  Chain.  Wi--Fi  sharing  will  target  individual  users,  whilst  the  E2P  SMS  application  will   bring  enterprise  clients  onboard.  Qlink  will  first  roll  out  the  E2P  SMS  service  to  Android   users,  whilst  the  iOS  version  is  undergoing  research  and  development.  Qlink  aims  to  publish   the  code  for  these  applications  to  GitHub  by  the  end  of  Q1  2018.  The  launch  will  also  include  
the  Qlink  mobile  and  desktop  app.   Phase  Two  --  End  of  Q2  2018  
Qlink  will  develop  the  mobile  data  access  and  content  distribution  protocol  and  deploy  to   the  Public  Chain.  Qlink  aims  to  publish  the  code  for  these  applications  to  GitHub  by  the  end   of  Q2  2018.  The  launch  will  also  include  enhanced  versions  of  the  Qlink  mobile  and  desktop  
apps,  along  with  the  Qlink  Gateway.   Phase  Three  --  End  of  Q4  2018     
Qlink  will  launch  the  Qlink  Chain,  which  will  be  co--developed  by  Onchain,  and  will  also   launch  the  Qlink  BaseStation.  Qlink  aims  to  publish  all  phase  three  code  to  GitHub  and  debut   the  BaseStation  prototype  by  the  end  of  Q4  2018.  The  launch  will  also  include  cross--chain  
protocol.  
25  

6.  Qlink  Token  
QLC  is  the  token  of  the  Qlink  ecosystem  and  it  will  circulate  between  content  providers,   asset  owners  and  users.      QLC  tokens  are  used  to  pay  for  Wi--Fi  access,  mobile  data  access,  E2P  SMS  packages,  and   registration  of  content  on  the  Qlink  Chain,  along  with  rewarding  users  for  viewing  the   sponsored  content.  QLC  can  also  be  acquired  by  using  the  Qlink  BaseStation  to  contribute  to   the  network  through  mining.      Six  hundred  million  (600,000,000)  QLC  tokens  will  be  minted  during  the  token  sale,  with  no   further  tokens  being  created  in  the  future.  
6.1.  Token  Standard  
Qlink  is  excited  to  become  a  part  of  the  NEO  community.  As  the  first  open  source  blockchain   in  China,  NEO  has  many  users  and  an  experienced  development  community.      More  importantly,  NEO  token  holders  have  the  ability  to  vote  in  trustworthy  consensus   nodes,  who  are  responsible  for  verifying  network  transactions  through  the  Delegated   Byzantine  Fault  Tolerance  (dBFT)  consensus  algorithm.      In  comparison,  blockchains  that  utilize  Proof--of--Stake  (PoS)  or  Proof--of--Work  (PoW)   algorithms  rely  on  nodes  that  can  be  run  by  any  user  with  a  large  quantity  of  coins  or  those   who  are  able  to  contribute  large  amounts  of  computing  power.   Therefore,  NEO's  dBFT  approach  results  in  higher  quality  consensus  nodes  and  a  more   efficient  network,  reducing  both  the  potential  security  risks  and  resource  wastage  of  PoS   and  PoW  respectively.  As  Qlink  requires  a  high  level  of  security  for  the  storage  of  telecom   infrastructure  assets,  the  NEO  blockchain  is  the  most  appropriate  choice.     
Qlink  will  consult  with  NEO  to  issue  tokens  that  comply  with  NEO's  NEP--5  protocol.

6.4.  Foundation  Governance  
The  token  sale  fund  will  be  used  for  the  development  of  the  Qlink  project  and  the  growth  of   Qlink  ecosystem,  which  includes,  but  not  limited  to,  Product  R&D,  Business  Development,   Strategic  Alliance  (e.g.  Joint  Venture),  and  potential  Merge  and  Acquisitions  of  important   assets.  The  Qlink  team  will  strive  to  keep  the  project  transparent  for  the  benefit  of  all   supporters.  To  accomplish  this  goal,  the  Qlink  team  will  continually  update  the  wider   community  with  new  information  regarding  platform  development  and  fund  status  as   pertinent  news  becomes  available.  Additionally,  further  important  information  will  be   published  on  the  official  Qlink  website.  
The  use  of  ETH  and  NEO  raised  during  the  token  sale  will  require  a  multi--sig  by  members  of   the  Qlink  Foundation.  Additionally,  the  Qlink  Foundation  will  be  audited  annually  by  a   professional  auditing  firm  specializing  in  foundation  operation  and  risk  assessments.  
Funds  raised  will  be  used  in  the  following  areas:
