1. OVERVIEW
SIRIN LABS - the developer of SOLARIN, an ultra-secure mobile phone - is holding a crowdsale event of SIRIN LABS tokens (SRN Tokens). Funds raised will support the development of FINNEYTM, the first open source blockchain smartphone and all-in-one PC. Alongside the support of the SOLARIN mobile phone. Customers will be able to purchase all SIRIN LABS products (SOLARIN and FINNEYTM) and services with SRN Tokens.
The current generation of smart devices compromises on user security. The focus is overwhelmingly on user experience, at a huge cost in fraud and cybercrime. We believe the digital economy of the future cannot tolerate this trade-off: device architecture demands a paradigm shift that enables true security, while maintaining excellent user experience.
FINNEYTM devices are the first cyber-protected, blockchain-enabled mobile phone and PC. They enjoy the functionality of AndroidTM OS, plus a suite of cyber security technologies, giving users safe, reliable access to the blockchain.
FINNEYTM devices form an independent blockchain network, a distributed ledger both scalable and lightweight, powered by IOTA's Tangle technology and SIRIN LABS' security ecosystem. FINNEYTM is free from centralized backbones and mining centers, capable of providing fast, fee-less and secure transactions.
FINNEYTM devices will run on SIRIN LABS' open-source operating system, SIRIN OSTM. This is designed to support inherent blockchain applications, such as a cold storage crypto wallet, secure exchange access, encrypted communications and a P2P resource sharing ecosystem for payment (not by means of SRN Tokens)The SRN is the exclusive way to acquire SIRIN LABS full line of products and services.
SIRIN LABS will partner with consumer electronics OEMs to promote the adoption of FINNEYTM architecture and SIRIN OSTM. Both will be released under open source licenses.

3. PROBLEM DOMAIN
We plan to solve these main challenges:
3.1 Securing the Blockchain Ecosystem
Smartphones and PCs were never designed with security or privacy as a major factor, though these are essential to ensure the trust of the blockchain network. As technologies such as cryptocurrency mining, trading, and online payments become available for these devices, they turn into even more valuable targets for malicious actors.
Many apps that we download, harvest data by asking for more permission types than are really needed (for example, flashlight apps that need access to your contacts) and so jeopardize our privacy. Nowadays, smartphones are just as vulnerable to hackers and malware as PCs but are even harder to protect. Another problem with modern smartphones is that they have so many capabilities. Thanks to a hypercompetitive marketplace, there is a constant race to add more and more features. This has two implications: 1) security often lags behind, and 2) the potential attack surface is enormous. It is relatively easy for a determined attacker to hack a device, access it and obtain data. There have been several attempts to tighten up smartphone security - like the introduction of end-to-end encryption on some widely-used messaging apps such as WhatsApp and WeChat. But unfortunately, this is not enough. While an app may be secure, this does not help if you have already been tricked into downloading a piece of malware that sends screen captures of your messages or records your calls.
To prevent such attacks, smartphones must be secured not only against external intrusions, but also at the hardware low-level of the phone itself. This can only be done through tightening the operating system itself, which means that a phone must be developed in its entirety, as the necessary level of protection cannot be achieved through app development alone. These considerations have forced manufacturers of secure mobile phones to develop phones, which are both expensive to produce and provide limited usability in favor of security, and therefore leave no room for advanced features.
We plan to tackle and solve these security and privacy challenges while maintaining full uncompromised usability.
3.2 Using cryptocurrencies is not trivial
A major barrier to mass-market adoption of cryptocurrencies is the technical complexity of their use. While the actual sending of funds is simple as any other means of payment, applying reasonable protection of one's wallet from being lost or stolen is very complicated.
With an operating system designed to be inherently secure, combined with hardware that can essentially implement a cold storage wallet, software can automatically provide the best practice handling of cryptocurrencies: store keys in the cold storage wallet; separate frequently-used wallets from rarely-used ones; direct the user to delegate recovery tools when their wallets accrue high balances, etc.
3.3 Monetization of Secured and Trusted P2P Sharing of Resources
The spread of stationary and mobile consumer electronics during the 21st century - smartphone, laptop, tablet, PC, etc.- places a wide range of both opportunities and hazards.

On the one hand, each person owns various types of digital resources, such as data connectivity, energy, computational power, environmental information, embedded in his private consumer electronics device's software and hardware. Some of these resources are available to one person and in short supply to the others. On the other hand, there is no widespread technology that enables resource sharing of such needed means, pro bono or for profit, and even if such technology existed, the current day-to-day cyber-attacks, threats, and the limited trust between persons, acquaintances and strangers, would prevent such resource sharing.
Imagine a tourist or a businessman, landing in San-Francisco, while his smartphone has almost no battery power and his roaming data plan doesn't work properly. A stranger nearby might give him 20% percent of battery power and provide him with access to his local mobile data plan. This resource sharing exchange would take place while maintaining three key qualities:
· Trust - the two strangers can totally trust each other for sharing the agreed upon resources and fee · Security - the resource sharing is conducted between ultra-secured cyber protection devices, that
prevents aimed or deceive cyber-attacks between the devices, and without compromising the security of the parties and the resources, while conducting the mobile data tethering process
· Monetization support - in the future, SIRIN LABS intends on supporting the monetization of each
resource owner, allowing him or her to gain micro payment fees for his or her contribution (not by means of SRN Tokens), based on the trust of the blockchain infrastructure (see section 9).
SIRIN LABS's ecosystem and SIRIN OSTM, its products deliversand services deliver the opportunity to execute a widespread, trusted and cyber protected, peer-to-peer resource sharing, from one consumer electronic device to others. This ecosystem gives the community of Blockchainblockchain developers the opportunity to create a diverse domain of trusted and secured resource sharing applications and services, per micro payment, (not by means of SRN Tokens), for example:
· Resources - data connectivity, energy, computational power · Data - local weather, traffic status · And the sky is the limit
3.4 Need for Fair, Decentralized App-Store
Most users retrieve the apps they use through an app store, managed by the OS vendor of their device. These stores provide users with little value, mostly in the form of auditing and reviewing apps ensuring better protection of the users from malware, at a high cost: store charge roughly 30% of the developer's proceeds, including most forms of in-app payments, out of developers' pockets. Most estimates put the combined revenues of Apple and Google from operating their app stores in recent years at between 50b$-100b$ annually.
But the damage to users is even higher. The operators of the app stores use their monopolistic power to impose censorship on the app offering: from barring apps that contain unapproved contents (such as gambling or adult content apps), to bolder limitations on apps that pose a risk to the operator's business (for example, Apple blocked all blockchain wallets for the lion's part of 2014).
SIRIN's D-App Store is a decentralized store for any type of app, in which users pay developers 100% of their subscription fees directly. Auditing services providing security protection, parental control etc. may be provided by trusted 3rd parties and sold directly to the subscriber.

4.2 SIRIN OSTM
The FINNEYTM Smartphone and FINNEYTM PC devices will use the SIRIN LABS' open source SIRIN OSTM, an AndroidTM based operating system with an ultra-secure cryptography core. At the center of the SIRIN OSTM there is a distributed, scalable, light-weight, and ASIC-resistant ledger. SIRIN OSTM is designed and ready to run on millions of smart electronic devices around the globe. SIRIN OSTM implements an ultra-secure, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions mechanism with a user-friendly, hassle-free interface. Those are the enablers: feeless & fast payments (without involvement of SIRIN LABS), resource sharing, and service offering. To ensure the integrity of the distributed leger transaction, SIRIN OSTM will offer multi-layered cyber protection. It makes use of innovative methods to secure the weakest link in cryptocurrency transactions, which is in the interface between the wallet, the internet connection, and the blockchain network.
SIRIN OSTM is built with the following features:
4.2.1 BlockShieldTM BlockShieldTM is SIRINLABS' propriety technology that ensures the integrity of transactions. BlockShieldTM consists of multiple protection layers built into the devices manufactured by SIRIN LABS, Trusted Display, IP Address Hiding and MAC Address Randomization.
4.2.2 Built-in hardware "cold storage" crypto wallet The main goal of the wallet is to safeguard the user's private key. The wallet also displays the user's balance, transactions history and public address. It is hardware based embedded inside the TrustCore TM, a tamper-resistant secured element, which is protected by SIRINLABS' BlockShieldTM technology - a secure area, protected by a physical switch. When the embedded wallet is not being used, it will be physically and electronically disconnected from the network.
The wallet will allow holding multiple accounts and will support Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Dash, Zcash, Ripple, Stratis, Dogecoin and other leading cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, it allows to hold the SRN Tokens.

4.2.3 Cyber Protection
The entire device is being multilayered cyber protected, ranging from low level OS up to the application layer. Acknowledging the dynamic nature of cyber threats, SIRIN LABS is developing a multilayer, behavioral-based and machine-learning Intrusion Prevention System (IPS).
4.2.4 Distributed Ledger Consensus (DLC) module
The DLC module enables approving transactions with a fee-less consensus mechanism, which allows fast payments between the network peers, without the need for mining. The consensus is based on a Tangle network consensus algorithm.

4.2.5 Decentralized App-Store (D-AAP)
We believe that variety, collaboration and openness are key to the success of the app ecosystem on SIRIN OSTM. To stimulate SIRIN OSTM, SIRIN LABS will introduce the D-APP Store - an open, fee-less and censorshipfree marketplace for apps. The D-APP Store is a digital distribution channel for apps and services, providing developers with distribution, subscription management and in-app payments solutions, and providing users with discovery, updates and auditing services.
Unlike conventional centralized app stores, SIRIN OSTM App Store will be managed by the community in a decentralized way: users may use the services of a trusted auditor of their choice to review, rate and/or filter the assortment of apps they see.
Paid apps and in-app payments will be based on secure peer-to-peer resource sharing which will distribute the fee between app and services developers and end users. Much like conventional app stores, users will be able to search for apps and services based on predefined categories.
4.2.6 Peer-to-Peer Resource Sharing Market Module
SIRIN OSTM offers developers a software development kit (SDK) that enables access to the OS's blockchain features and functionalities, which in turn offer sharing of digital resources and services between peers or group of users. These services can be based on the device's camera, data, storage, security, location etc.

SIRIN LABS ­ CROWDSALE ­ Whitepaper - V2.4

12

4.2.7 SDK for Distributed Applications Development
SIRIN LABS will offer developers worldwide a Software Development Kit (SDK) that enables faster and more secure development of distributed apps for the blockchain generation, based on our network capabilities and functionalities, taking advantage of a seamless and secure peer-to-peer resource sharing and payment system (not by means of SRN Tokens).
SIRIN LABS' SDK will implement and make available all the building blocks of decentralization ­ gossip protocol, decentralized database, voting/polling mechanism and oracle API.
Using SIRIN LABS' SDK, developers could get directly paid for software, services and tangibles. In addition, users can make "in-app" micropayments.

5. SIRIN LABS SECURE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY
5.1 Overview and Requirements
SIRIN OSTM, the basis for FINNEYTM devices, is a freely distributed open source operating system based on AndroidTM, designed to enable safe use of blockchain applications on mainstream devices. The SIRIN OSTM provides an enhanced blockchain features, decentralized resource sharing and a lightweight, fee-less and quantum-proof transactions of cryptocurrencies (without involvement of SIRIN LABS).
5.1.1 Security Requirements
To enable mass market adoption of blockchain technologies, cryptographic tools should be a simple and foolproof. Experience with the first generations of connected payment systems shows that any vulnerability that may exist between the moment a sensitive information is processed (on a network or storage) up to the moment it is displayed to end users (such as on display) is eventually exploited, and at large scale. Complex procedures of maintaining key pairs, protecting private keys, planning one's recovery procedures and verifying transaction data are routine for today's blockchain users, but cannot be routine for all users.
The security scheme used in SIRIN OSTM must ensure that private keys are never exposed, and can only be accessed by a limited set of "secure mode" procedures, that are included in the OS, that authenticate the user and sign transactions or method calls with the keys. Keeping the secrets out of reach is the only way to ensure that it is impossible to steal them by using malware, by exploiting a bug in an app or even by cheating the user into sharing his secrets.
Additionally, users must have a simple and foolproof way of distinguishing fake from real payment interfaces, to protect them from phishing attempts. This requires a physical indicator on the device shell of when the device is in secure mode. Such indicator can be a unique LED, a physical switch, or even a separate screen for secure mode operations. Users of the device only need to learn that the physical indicator must be set in order for them to make payments or other secure operations.
While the above requirements are mandatory to prevent wallets being compromised by theft, phishing or keylogging, one must note that the advanced features enabled by FINNEYTM create new opportunities for attackers. Specifically, we believe that resource sharing (and particularly sharing of CPU and network resources) could create a risk of eavesdropping and breach of access restrictions. To mitigate that risk, FINNEYTM will feature cybersecurity elements as a service by SIRIN LABS.
5.1.2 Blockchain Requirements
The blockchain operations provided natively by SIRIN OSTM can be used on any common blockchain technology. However, for common usages of payments and resource sharing, we find that none of the current standard blockchains is suitable for mainstream users.
The native blockchain used for payments and resource sharing must provide fast transaction confirmation, ensure extremely low transaction costs to enable micropayments, and have light clients capable of operating nodes on devices with entry-level CPU and limited network connectivity. PoW design that enables a long-state equilibrium in which user devices do most of the validations in the network, rather than centralized mining pools, is also required to ensure the long-term independence of the network.

SIRIN LABS ­ CROWDSALE ­ Whitepaper - V2.4

14

5.1.3 Hardware Adaptation Requirements
To comply with the private-key protection schemes and anti-phishing measures required by SIRIN OSTM, two security requirements must be aided by hardware elements: protection of private keys from application access, and user protection from phishing.
Naturally, special hardware requirements may add a burden on manufacturers and designers, which we must ensure will not be a barrier to widespread adoption of SIRIN OSTM. To counter that, SIRIN LABS will provide a choice of hardware designs (and certify other designs if suggested by 3rd parties) that can satisfy these requirements, allowing OEMs to choose the design that can best fit their constraints.
5.1.4 Resource Sharing Requirements
Perhaps the most promising capability of a blockchain device is its ability to dynamically trade its resources with other devices, thus providing its users with better experience as they need it and better utilizing its resources when not in use.
Resource sharing must be seamless, secure and efficient for mass-market users to enjoy it. SIRIN OSTM introduces a virtualization layer between the OS interfaces and any of its shareable resources, making access to each of the resources virtualized both by the sharer and by the receiver. This ensures that partners to a shared resource (such as network or CPU) cannot undermine each other's security or privacy. The virtualized containers will also provide accurate metering of the shared resource; the sharer meters the amount of use of the shared resource at his sole discretion.
Two types of resource sharing protocols will be designed: LocalBoostTM for sharing resources with directlyconnected devices, and CloudBoostTM for sharing resources over the network. SIRIN LABS will publish an RFC for both protocols. Being open protocols, any device -- not just SIRIN OSTM devices -- may contribute or use resources; this allows WiFi routers, cloud or edge-cloud computing services, public charging stations and many other devices to be also a part of the resource sharing network.
5.1.5 Development Methodology
SIRIN OSTM is developed in accordance with the SDLC (Security Development Lifecycle), and OWASP SCP including secure coding and penetration testing done by specialized 3rd parties and occasional hacker bounties.
5.2 Hardware Designs and Abstraction Workflows
Ensuring the secure use of blockchain apps by user requires hardware capable of secure execution: isolating private-key usages from other functionalities, in such way that secure code can access its own secure storage, and that its communications to the display and user input device(s) are protected from eavesdropping or manipulation by insecure code. Another required hardware capability is visual indication: there must exist a clear and simple indication for the user of when the device is in secure mode.
SIRIN LABS will provide at least two hardware designs to meet the secure execution requirement: one requiring that the main chipset be of an architecture that support secure enclaves (such as TEE - Trusted Execution Environment supporting chips), and one supporting any chipset when connected to a Secure Element (SE) chip. The former will enable OEM hardware vendors to adapt their existing board designs to use

SIRIN LABS ­ CROWDSALE ­ Whitepaper - V2.4

15

SIRIN OSTM with little or no changes, whereas the latter may require new board designs but due to the low cost of SE chips, will have minimal effect on the overall BOM.
To meet the visual indication requirement, we recommend a physical switch requiring the user to actively move the switch for transition between secure and ultra-secure modes. Alternatively, a dedicated indicator LED that will only light up when in secure mode can be used. The indicator should be easily distinguishable from any other visual indicator on the device, making it easy for users to learn that they should only authenticate transactions when in secure mode.
Example: Abstract Workflow
Although the design alternatives use different approaches to isolating the wallet storage and computation, and to the physical indication of secure I/O, all use the same abstract workflows for wallet operations. For example, currency transfer follows this workflow:
1. The user chooses to send currency in a supporting app, (e.g. a peer-to-peer messaging app) 2. The app creates a document containing the transaction details ("raw transaction"). Optionally, the app
may attempt to acquire the destination address' owner certificate - an SSL certificate indicating that the real-world name and address of the recipient. 3. The app calls the SignTransaction() method of the "Wallet Interface Service" provided by SIRIN OSTM. This call sends the raw transaction to the wallet hardware (either secure enclave or an SE chip). 4. Secure mode visual indication is turned on. 5. The hardware wallet displays (on secure display) the transaction details: amount transferred and destination address; if an owner certificate was attached to the transaction, the recipient name and address will also be shown. It then asks for user authentication for approval of the transaction. 6. If the user authenticated and approved the transaction, the secure code will sign the transaction using the private keys stored in the secured storage and send it back to the app. Next, it will exit secure mode. 7.    Secure mode visual indication is turned off. 8. The messaging app is back in control, it received a signed transaction which it may send to the blockchain to commit the transaction.
5.3 Architecture
Adaptation Layer and HAL

SIRIN LABS ­ CROWDSALE ­ Whitepaper - V2.4

16

The Adaptation Layer and the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) defines a standard interface for OEMs to integrate SIRIN OSTM on top of their existing Software / Hardware platforms, in order to abstract resource access in a secured manner. Just as the resource sharing protocols, LocalBoostTM and CloudBoostTM, are not limited to a specific device -- the abstractions built into SIRIN OSTM to support hardware can be ported to any type of devices or on top of an existing Operating System.
5.4 System Services and Core Libraries
System Services are modular components exposed by the SIRIN OSTM to the Application Framework and its APIs.

The system services cooperate to provide the core functionality of the SIRIN OSTM over existing hardware devices by taking advantage of the SIRIN OSTM stack of core libraries. The core components of the System Services layer are:
5.4.1 DLC: Decentralized Ledger Component
To best meet the requirements of the native blockchain (fast, fee-less, scalable transaction over light clients), SIRIN LABS is cooperating with IOTA Foundation with the intention of integrating a Tangle-based Ledger Technology into SIRIN OSTM (IOTA Tangle is described in [1]).
The DLC is a component that is designed to meet the implementation requirements of IOTA:
· Managing secure P2P transactions among devices over the Tangle network · Perform the Tangle's Tip Selection algorithm as described in IOTA whitepaper. · Performing hash calculations and verify selected previous transactions.
5.4.2 Wallet Interface Service
In SIRIN OSTM devices, access to private keys is only available for the hardware wallet module. The Wallet Interface Service provides apps with API access to the wallet, enabling them to have currency transfers and smart contract calls signed. The hardware wallet (either running on a separate chip with its own storage, or in an enclave with exclusive access to the secure storage holding the private keys) asks for user authentication and approval, and returns the signed transaction if approved.

Further access protection to application that are guarded by the SecureShieldTM can be done through a physical security switch and two factor authentications that is managed by the Authentication Manager.
SCS: Secured Communication Suite (optional for OEMs)
The Secure Communication Suite is a set of comprehensive endpoint-to-endpoint encryption solutions that provide secure communication on connected devices to safeguard sensitive conversations against eavesdropping by malicious actors.
SCS is comprised of secure and encrypted Voice Calling, Secure Text Messaging, File Transfer, E-mail SCS uses a PKI cryptosystem stored in a hardware-protected keystore stored on SIRIN LABS TrustCore TM. The robust encryption framework leverages 2048-bit RSA and a cryptosystem with AES 256-bit symmetric session keys.
As we expect developers and vendors to adopt SIRIN OSTM enhance the security and privacy of communications and resource sharing developments and bring SIRIN OSTM advantages to the public, so is SCS applications enhance its security and privacy by using SIRIN OSTM APIs.
SCS uses SIRIN OSTM for various use cases like:
1. Service authentication. 2. Negotiation between peers, for example: encrypted call establishment. 3. Payments and Micro payments, for example:
- Charge users for app services. - Transfer payments between users 4. Security resources sharing, for example: - User can lease his device hardware encryption engine. 5. Post an alert to others when a threat is detected
5.5.2 OS Layer
Policy Manager
The Policy Manager aggregates data that is collected from sensors embedded in the OS kernel, as well as in the device firmware. It can execute actions and countermeasures to dynamic cyber threat policies, to contain and restrain the cyber-attacks. Example for such actions and counter measure are:
· Pausing / Blocking SW Installations · Blocking Connections · Terminating Suspected Processes
etc.
SIRIN LABS PROTECTORTM backend system manages cyber threat dynamic policies, according to day-to-day changes in the worldwide landscape of cyber threats. These policies are pushed OTA to the devices upon need.
IPS: Behavioral-based Intrusion Prevention System (optional for OEMs)
Acknowledging the dynamic nature of cyber threats, SIRIN LABS is developing a multilayer, behavioralbased and machine-learning IPS, protecting against known and unknown threats (including Zero-Day

SIRIN LABS ­ CROWDSALE ­ Whitepaper - V2.4

20

attacks). This relies on our extensive experience developing SOLARIN, the most secure smartphone in the world. ("Meet the safest smartphones in the world!" ­ https://bballmaster.com/meet-safest-smartphonesworld/ ).
BlockShieldTM includes a continuous on-device behavioral-based cyber-protection engine, against networks attacks, host-based (malware) attacks, and physical attacks. The IPS engine, which is in an Always-On state (including during offline and flight mode), monitors the entire device for malicious behavior and dynamically detects in real-time both known and unknown threats and attacks (including Zero-Day). The IPS engine identifies, prevents and shields the devices against a wide range of cyber threats and attacks from diverse entry points, such as:
· WiFi Network attacks ­ ARP MITM (Man-in-the-Middle), traffic-tampering, SSL strip, ICMP redirect
MITM, fake SSL certificate attacks, rogue WiFi Access Points, or
· Suspicious baseband behavior - Such as Silent SMS, unexpected downgrade of 3G/4G encryption, etc. · Host-based attacks (behavioral-based and not signature-based) ­ suspected APK (from the Google
Play store, other app stores, website, email, and FTP), EOP (Elevation of Privilege), system tampering, device jailbreaking or rooting
· Physical attacks ­ ROM tampering, preloaded application authenticity tampering, hardware tampering
The IPS engine is backed-up with a Cyber-Incident Response Team (CIRT), that enhances the cybersecurity level of the devices using proactive monitoring and analysis. The CIRT investigates the online cyber threats and mitigates them to assist customers with managing security issues related to usage of the devices.
Authentication Manager
Recognizing the inherent weaknesses of traditional self-determined authentication methods, such as PIN, pattern, or password, SIRIN LABS offers a range of authentication methods, integrating methods of selfdetermined authentication with biometric authentication. BlockShieldTM supports two sets of authentication methods, one set for each zone (the "regular" zone and the shielded zone). For each set, the customer may choose which authentication methods to use to protect their privacy and security.
Optional authentication methods include:
· Self-determined ­ password, PIN, pattern, swipe, or none · Biometric ­ fingerprint, iris recognition and/or retina scan (on supporting devices)
The devices enable the end-user to determine the authentication protection level of the selected section:
1. None 2. Self-determined only 3. Self-determined + single biometric authentication 4. Self-determined + double biometric authentications 5. One-factor biometric authentication 6. Two biometric authentications
The self-determined and biometric prints are stored in a hardware-secured element within the smartphone and within the all-in-one computer, enhancing the security level of this sensitive data.

Device Integrity (optional for OEMs) One ominous threat in the cyber-security landscape is that of hardware and software tampering of consumer electronic devices. The main counter-measure is to tamper-proof the hardware and software components' authenticity. SIRIN LABS is developing an advanced, unique blockchain-based, tamper-proof mechanism, for both the hardware and software components of electronic devices. Device Integrity subsystem verifies mechanisms to verify the authenticity of firmware and hardware across devices:
Hardware Tampering Prevention (optional for OEMs) The Device Integrity module supports the integration of secure device assembly inside factory using supply chain management that is controlled by blockchain. Selected hardware component's authenticity verification is done throughout their lifecycle, from their assembly line by the ODMs, through shipment. Selected component's hash is stored on a distributed ledger and verified against the associated devices of SIRIN LABS' blockchain network. Any attempt to tamper with or replace the selected hardware components of the devices is detected by the Device Integrity module and cause in IPS event which can be propagated to UI indication to the customer, and appropriate countermeasures according to the analyzed severity of the incident.
Firmware Tampering Prevention (optional for OEMs) Similarly, any attempt to perform unauthorized software update or replacement of the device sensitive components (such as bootloader, Kernel, System Services, etc.) and other sensitive selected software components, is detected and causes an event in the IPS, with appropriate functional countermeasures.
Secure Boot (optional for OEMs) The Secure Boot mechanism that is built into BlockShieldTM guarantees the integrity of the device software starting from a hardware root of trust up to the system partition. During boot, each stage verifies the integrity and authenticity of the next stage before executing it. Any integrity violation that is detected during boot is reported to the IPS to provide warning on the local device and the boot sequence is hold.
Encrypted Storage - (optional for OEMs, except in hardware wallet) The Encrypted Storage subsystem support an integration of full encrypted storage that is backed by either software or hardware.
Trusted Display The Trusted Display ensures that the information typed by the end-user is securely controlled by taking advantage of Trusted Execution Environment (such as TrustZone by ARM, QSEE by Qualcomm, etc.). Trusted Display protects and validates the input-output chain, starting from the input device (such as touch screen, fingerprint sensor, keyboard, or mouse) up to the user interface and the device's physical display.

Whenever a user makes a transaction, the information displayed is derived from the TEE, which prevents any non-secure application, potential malware or malicious actor from tampering with or sniffing the transaction details.
Privacy Manager (optional for OEMs)
The Privacy Manager subsystem provides a togglable anonymization to protect user's privacy.
MAC Address Randomization (optional for OEMs)
Whenever a transaction is initiated on a blockchain, the client sends the necessary data to other clients, effectively broadcasting the transfer to the network.  As most blockchain protocols do not encrypt their traffic, it is possible for prying eyes or a malicious actor to peek into the transactions and determine the wallet's balance with little effort.  For a sophisticated third party, it is therefore entirely possible to gather data about transactions performed and reveal the identity of cryptocurrency users at large. The Privacy Manager, also supports integration to VPN provided by 3rd parties.
5.5.3 Hardware Layer: TrustCoreTM (optional for OEMs*)
SIRIN LABS TrustCoreTM is a tamper resistant hardware Secure Element (SE) capable of securely hosting confidential and cryptographic data (e.g. key management) and using them for transaction authentication without exposing the secret data to the main CPU or storage. SIRIN OSTM uses TrustCoreTM to securely store:
· Encryption keys (Encrypted Storage, Encrypted Communication, etc.) · Biometric templates (such as fingerprints, retina, iris)
(*) OEMs adopting SIRIN OSTM may choose to use other Secure Element chips based on compliant specification.
