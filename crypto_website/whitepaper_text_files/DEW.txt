1. Introduction
Genesis Vision is the platform for the private trust management market, built on blockchain technology and smart contracts. We unite exchanges, brokers, traders, and investors into a decentralized, open and fair network, making the financial market even more global. This will allow successful traders to rapidly scale their trading strategies by attracting investments from around the world. The smart contract technology that underlies the platform will provide an automated and absolutely transparent system for investment and profit distribution.
The Genesis Vision platform is the solution for the most crucial industry problems, such as limitedness due to the lack of information, lack of transparency and, consequently, lack of trust.
Fundraising and the use of GVT (Genesis Vision Token) will help to finance product development, marketing and advertising for the development of the platform. GVT is an internal currency of Genesis Vision platform and will be used for all investment operations and profit distributions.
2. Market Description
2.1 Market Participants
Managers Management funds/traders are companies/individuals with a proven trading history, ready to acquire investors' money for management. The profit, received as a result of management of the total funds, is shared proportionally between the managers and investors. Managers receive a commission for management and a commission from the profit (success fee).
Investors Investors do not trade in the market directly. Instead, investors transfer their funds to experienced traders who manage the funds for them. Investors get their shares from their managers' profits.
Brokers Brokers are companies that have the appropriate licenses to carry out brokerage activities. Through brokers, traders have access to trading financial instruments on exchange and over-the-counter markets.

Traditional Trust Management From a technological point of view, traditional fiduciary management systems are a black box to potential investors, because how they work is not always known or understood. In any event, all of the current solutions boil down to the investor using some software to transfer money to a financial manager and then waiting to receive profits. However, investors have no opportunity to control their own funds. Furthermore, the fiduciary management system itself doesn't give investors any technical abilities to ensure that their funds are returned, nor does it provide an understanding of how the money is used.
The investors receive a statistic on the use of their assets and the financial manager's performance, but this statistic is determined entirely by the company and financial manager. At present, investors have essentially no way to verify this information. Too often, the real situation is understood too late, when the money can no longer be returned.
Dishonest companies exploit this, scheming to attract customers by using high figures that turn out to be not so promising in reality.
Our system adds transparency and, on a technological level, increases asset security and information reliability. Decentralization guarantees that one person won't be able to use the entire system for his personal interests.
3. Description of the Problem
Despite the industry's steady growth, existing trust management mechanisms do not meet the requirements of modern investors and managers.
Managers, and consequently their investors, are tied to their brokers/exchanges. Simultaneously, there is no consolidated reliable source of information or statistics. This deprives investors of flexibility in their choices and limits the manager's ability to attract new funds.

The lack of transparency further exacerbates the situation. Brokers have the technical ability to influence the data on the trade history and statistics of their managers. The potential investor does not have the ability to distinguish the real trade history from the counterfeit, and the existing graph of the manager's profit from the "drawn". The mechanisms of investment, distribution of profits and commissions are hidden inside the realization of trading platforms and are not open to market participants.

Broker - Information can't be verified

A large number of fraudulent conducts in the trust management market was detected in recent years[1]. A lot of Ponzi schemes were created under the guise of currency, stocks and other assets trading. Fraudsters used the fact that technological solutions for trust management by default are very complicated and non-transparent for users. As a result, customers lost their money overnight, and investor's confidence in the market as a whole began to fall.
The natural reaction for this situation was tightening the regulations in this sphere. Nowadays companies have to come a long and expensive way in order to obtain licence for trust management activities. Conscientious companies have to implement complex and costly reporting and auditing systems as well as to impose serious restrictions for investors. Obviously, neither companies nor investors benefit from that. However, offshore companies continue operating without licences and deceiving their clients.
All of these factors lead to serious limitations on the potential of market participants, lack of usability, and lack of trust.
Despite the visibility of the existing problems in the industry, for the past 10 years, the mechanisms of interaction between market participants have not undergone significant changes. This indicates the need to introduce new technologies that will change the current situation.
We believe that one of such technologies can become the blockchain. Implementation of blockchain will allow trust management market to achieve transparency and efficiency on the technological level. This will help to regain the trust to the market. Besides that, it will attract the attention of new companies and the investors of the new digital generation.

4. Our Solution
Genesis Vision is a decentralized trust management platform built on blockchain technology and smart contracts. Blockchain technology provides indispensable advantages, such as openness, immutability, and censorship-resistance of all stored information, whereas smart contracts, which will be carrying out investment and profit distribution, make these processes completely transparent and open.
Each manager in the Genesis Vision network has his own cryptocurrency. The size of the issue depends on successful trade statistics. The process of transferring funds to the manager is carried out by buying a manager's cryptocurrency on the internal exchange.
From manager's point of view, the trade process will not change. The trader will continue to operate on the exchange or through a convenient broker. Genesis Vision, in turn, represents a common open source of reliable information about the statistics of the network participants' activities and an absolutely transparent system of investment and profit distribution, built on smart contracts.

4.1 Advantages for Investors
Investors have access to managers from all over the world. Information is available on their trading and profit statistics, which is now accessible in one place. The set of managers is not limited by any set of financial instruments Investors have the ability to invest both in the cryptocurrency and in the fiat currencies. Profit distribution is completely transparent and open There is better availability of investment portfolios for any request (high-risk, low-risk, etc.). Investors have additional protection, due to the fact that all managers have a real trading history that cannot be faked. Investing is now not just a transfer of money but the purchase of a cryptocurrency, which remains liquid throughout the process and can be resold at any time.
11

4.2 Advantages for Private Managers and Funds
There are increased opportunities to attract investors from any country, regardless of whether they are a client of the same broker or not. Transparency and fairness of report construction guarantees fair competition between all managers. There are excellent opportunities for promoting your own trading strategy to attract more investors. There is increased investor confidence, due to guaranteed transparency, which will lead to an increase in the average investor's check. Managers issue their own branded cryptocurrency, which can be freely traded by investors.
12

4.3 Advantages for Brokers
There is no centralized company. The company is decentralized and is represented by all network members.
Brokers have an opportunity to attract investors from all over the world.
Participation in the network is free with identical terms for all participants. All necessary software is open and free. If necessary, it can be further adjusted to meet the needs of the broker. Due to the openness of Genesis Vision software, brokers can be sure that their data is not compromised or disclosed.
Brokers have the right to do any marketing, use any methods of attracting managers, and establish any trading conditions for managers. The system does not require any information about the broker's client base. The only necessary information is the manager's trading history, which will be placed into the blockchain and the profit of the manager, which will be brought to the Genesis Vision system for distribution between investors.

Internal exchange of managers' cryptocurrencies Internal exchange of the Genesis Vision platform is the place where investors can purchase and sell managers' coins. Managers have a limited amount of coins, which depends on their level. Initially, these coins can only be purchased directly from the manager for a fixed price. Afterwards, they can be freely traded among the investors on the internal exchange. In this case, investors set their own price for their managers' coins. The cost of these coins will depend on the success of a manager's trading because the manager's profitable trading makes his/her coins "profitable."

6.1 Connecting a Broker
The broker's connection scheme is as simple as possible: the owner of the trading platform only needs to install the Genesis Vision software, which is free and distributed with an open license. Brokers can also provide potential managers' access to the Genesis Vision Manager registration function in their client application - generally a "Become a Genesis Vision Manager" button.
17

6.2 Connecting Managers
Traders submit applications either through their brokers' websites, connected to the Genesis Vision network, or directly through the website http://genesis.vision. Under simple conditions (having a minimum amount of one's own funds in a trading account), the trader becomes the manager on the Genesis Vision platform. From that moment, all managers' trades will be automatically verified, uploaded, and recorded in a smart contract, building a trustworthy trading history and statistics.
A new manager registration triggers the emission of his own cryptocurrency in the initial amount of one thousand coins, available for purchase to any member of the network. Additional issue of coins (i.e., attraction of additional funds to management) depends on the level of the manager, which, in turn, directly depends on the success indicators of a particular manager's trading.
Available investments depend on the level of the manager:

MAXIMUM INVESTMENTS $ 100 000 000

The manager trades using both his capital and the funds invested by investors. The profit received as a result of the trade is automatically distributed proportionally between managerial token holders at the end of the reporting period. Managers themselves choose the length of the reporting period, according to their trading strategies. The choice is limited to options such as one week, two weeks, one month or three months

18

6.3 Managers' Coins
Investing is performed by purchasing a manager's cryptocurrency. This method has several advantages over the traditional scheme of transferring money to a manager's account:
The manager's coin itself is an asset. At any time, the investor can transfer/sell this cryptocurrency on the internal exchange. The investor has the right to return the coins to the manager. However, the return occurs only at the end of the reporting period.
The additional element of gamification appears. Unlike the traditional scheme, the user does not just give his money to an unknown until the end of the reporting period. Instead, the user buys "tangible" coins that are displayed in his or her personal cabinet and can be cashed at any time. This encourages investors to potentially assemble large packages of different coins, which is a contrast to traditional investing.
There is an additional factor of involvement and user retention. In the traditional investment scheme, investors are not involved in the process that occurs between the moment of investing and making profits. In our case, they will be able to constantly monitor the exchange rates of their managers' coins and the issuance of new coins, trade cryptocurrency on the internal exchange and so forth.
When investors purchase coins, GVTs are transferred to a broker's account, where they are converted to required currency and transferred to a manager's trading account. Coin holders receive part of the manager's profits, according to their share, minus the manager's commission and fee. The investor has the right to transfer coins or sell on the internal exchange.
The investor can withdraw invested money, but only at the end of the reporting period, having previously created an application for withdrawal. In the case of returns, the investor receives the money according to his or her share, and the coins are returned to the manager for further sale on the internal exchange.
6.4 Detailed Process Description
Registration
1. In order to become a manager of Genesis Vision, traders confirm their participation on their broker's website or on the website http://genesis.vision. A prerequisite for participation is the availability of a minimum amount of their own funds in the trading account.
2. When registering, the manager indicates the length of his reporting period, in accordance with his trading strategy (one week, two weeks, one month, three months)
3. This completes the registration, and the trader enters the list of Genesis Vision managers.
3.1 The manager's trading account is blocked from depositing and withdrawing funds. 3.2 The Ethereum platform issues manager's own cryptocurrency in the amount of one thousand coins. Coins
immediately become available for investors to purchase in the primary market of the manager's cryptocurrencies. 3.3 The first reporting period begins.
19

Reporting period
During the reporting period, the manager trades on his or her trading platform with the amount of funds available at the beginning. The history of its trading is unloaded from the trading platform and recorded in IPFS in real time.
The manager can leave a request for deposit/withdrawal of his own funds from his trading account, which will be processed at the end of the reporting period. In this case, the amount of remaining funds should not be less than the minimum amount.
Investors can buy the manager's coins on the primary market for GVT. In this case, the transaction is recorded in the manager's smart contract and will be implemented at the end of the reporting period.
Investors can freely transfer and sell their coins on the internal exchange.
Investors can leave requests for withdrawal of their invested funds, which will be processed at the end of the reporting period.
End of the reporting period 1. The integration plug-in initiates the completion of the reporting period. 2. Each manager's profit is calculated. All received profit, minus the manager's commission, is transferred from the
broker's wallet to the address of the smart contract.
3. The integration plug-in executes requests for the input/output of funds received during the reporting period. 4. The next reporting period starts.
6.5 Managers' Trading History Control
One of the most important problems solved by Genesis Vision platform is the managers' trading history control and verification. If we were able to record all transactions in blockchain in real time, it would be a possible solution. But this is not feasible for a number of reasons:
Blockchain technical limitations. Processing of such a large number of transactions will create considerable load on blockchain platform.
Not all managers will agree to publish all their transactions in real time out of concern for their trading strategies protection. The problem of blockchain limitation can be avoided by using a number of existing technologies and new solutions: The broker's trading platform plug-in writes all transactions in IPFS.
An off-chain communication channel is created between members of the network (using the Whisper protocol or any other). After each manager's transaction, a hash of the current trading history is sent to the network.
20

Special service verifies that there were no history amendments, using received hashes and IPFS data.
Publishing managers' trades in real time potentially endangers their unique trading strategy. That is why traditional trust management systems usually offer an option to hide trading history during the reporting period. In Genesis Vision it would be implemented as follows:
At the beginning of reporting period, broker's trading platform plug-in generates a crypto key for the manager.
All managers' transactions are written in IPFS encrypted.
At the end of reporting period, a key for decryption is published and the entire trading history becomes public and available for validation by hashes.
7. The Implementation of the Genesis Vision Network
All code will be open and distributed with the maximum open license.
Brokers will be able to install software for integration, if their trading platform is supported.
Any developer or company will be able to add support for additional trading platforms.
Trading instruments, exchanges and markets are not limited.
Connection to the Genesis Vision network is free of charge and is performed by the brokers or exchanges on their own, or with the help of our partners.
Brokers and exchanges operating in crypto-markets will be involved.
7.1 Capturing the Market
The Genesis Vision project team has a number of advantages that will allow the project to be successful, and, most importantly, to be applied in a real operating business.
Our partners' companies have been engaged in technological maintenance and software development for brokerage companies, mainly in foreign exchange markets. Their experience allows them to integrate all of the necessary software into the industry without unnecessary costs and delays or difficulties from the broker's side. For example our partner Tools For Brokers inc. is servicing more than 250 companies from thirty different countries (35% - Europe, 35% - Asia, 25% - Middle East, 5% - Others).
All of these companies are potential brokers for the project. At the moment, Tools For Brokers already sells a similar centralized solution that is installed in the environment of a particular broker. This software was purchased by more than eighty different companies around the world. The total turnover of funds through this trust management
21

system amounted to more than $100 billion.
Considering our more than 400 contacts with brokerages among our partners and advisers, we expect at least 100 brokerages to join our distributed system within 2 years.
This will attract more than 100,000 investors and roughly 10,000 financial managers. According to industry reports, the average trading volume for a single investor is 5 Lots (500,000 USD including leverage) per month. Thus, the total trading volume in our distributed system could reach 50 billion USD.
Since this statistics involves only existing customers, it will make Genesis Vision one of the largest blockchain applications.
Current situation on the potential market shows that a new project with a decentralized transparent system is in demand in an industry in which regulation has become tougher, and transparency has become the main competitive advantage. It will soon become the only way to work in the market, which is why cooperation with financial brokers was chosen as the starting point of the project.
Trust management industry receives much negative feedback due to persistent stereotype of sticky-fingered brokers and overall lack of understanding of the industry operation mechanisms. We want to make it cleaner and better by using the latest technologies. Thanks to the Genesis Vision project, we will do it.
This will allow the project to move from the idea phase to an operating business as soon as possible. We will also further develop the project for all other markets including stock markets, cryptocurrency markets, futures markets, and so forth.
7.2 Possible Problems and Their Solutions
Blockchain restrictions Token sale and Genesis Vision platform prototype development will take place on Ethereum platform. We have chosen Ethereum because it is currently the most popular and functional blockchain platform. However, Ethereum has a number of serious and well-known flaws, the most critical being its lack of scalability and its high transaction cost.
At the early stage of our project, it's not a serious problem. However, the expected scale of Genesis Vision platform, according to the number of our potential broker clients, represents tens of thousands of managers, hundreds of thousands of investors, and millions of transactions. This level of load currently cannot be handled by Ethereum.
Despite Ethereum's flaws, we love its technology and are following its development plans closely. Vitalik Buterin has already announced many promising features in Ethereum's upcoming versions. We hope that these features will be able to improve the current situation.
At the moment, we are continuing our platform development, based on Ethereum. But in case we reach Ethereum's capabilities' limit (presumably it can happen in a one-year period), we can decide to switch to another blockchain, which will be able to meet the needs of the project.
Blockchain technologies are developing rapidly, and there are already some promising alternatives.
22

But in a one-year period, a new favorite may appear, and the choice will be obvious.
In case of blockchain platform change, all Ethereum tokens will be migrated. Token quantity and conditions for holders will remain unchanged.
Currency conversion problems Brokers will receive money from investors in GVT, but they will need to transfer funds to the manager's account in the manager's account currency.
Brokers are currently working with several currencies, and many of them are starting to also support cryptocurrencies:
https://www.allfxbrokers.com/brokers/deposit-options/bitcoin https://www.100forexbrokers.com/bitcoin-brokers In this way, brokers are able to cope with this problem on their own. However, in order to simplify this process for them and to increase the number of potential customers, Genesis Vision will offer brokers the following solutions: The opportunity to quickly exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat (as well as the reverse). For this purpose, we will have exchange partners and exchangers. A solution providing the service of supporting GVT as currency of trading account. This will help to avoid converting.
A solution to help in risk management for brokers.
8. Genesis Vision Fund
5% GVT will form the Genesis Vision fund. Tokens from this fund will be regularly invested in successful platform managers. We plan to keep the fund operating regardless of the profit it generates, constantly stimulating Genesis Vision managers' activity.
The main objectives of the fund are: Attracting managers in the system and stimulating their activities Providing additional liquidity of GVT on exchanges Providing additional liquidity of managers' tokens
8.1 Genesis Vision Investment AI
Investment decision-making process will be carried out by GV fund management AI. This system will utilize both Genesis Vision's and our partners' robust financial expertise and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.
23

9. Project Economics
9.1 Sources of Project Profit
The project will receive profit from commissions on investment operations. Each investment will be charged 0.5%³ of the operation amount. The project will also generate profit from managing its own fund and by investing it in successful managers of our platform.

10.1 Genesis Vision Token Sale Options
Recent Token Sale campaigns identified a number of problems in this process: People who have been following the project for a long time can simply be late to invest money.
A large influx of transactions in the first minutes after the launch of the Token Sale creates difficulties for Token Sale investors and other Ethereum blockchain users.
Due to the geographical dispersion of investors, participation for many of them may be compounded by the fact that the launch of Token Sale falls on a deep night in their time zone.
Early investment bonuses are often given not to actual first supporters, but to those who managed to be the first to carry out a transaction in the blockchain. To solve these and a number of other problems, Genesis Vision team is launching an option program for Token Sale participation.
Conditions Genesis Vision option guarantees the right to acquire GVT tokens at a specified price during the Token Sale. Genesis Vision option token is based on ERC20 Ethereum token standard.
The option price is 5% of the desired amount of investment.
Options will also give additional bonuses for tokens' amount:
To acquire the option, an Token Sale investor pays 5% of his total desired amount of investments. The amount of tokens available for the purchase during the Token Sale is calculated according to this formula:

A GVT

A ìnv + Bonus
R GVT

A GVT - the amount of tokens available for purchase with the option

A ìnv - total desired amount of investment

R GVT - GVT token rate ($1:1)

Bonus - current Token Sale bonus (30%) The price of a token for option holders is calculated according to this formula:

C op - the price of the option

C GVT

A ìnv - C op A GVT

Example:
An investor wants to invest $1000 in an upcoming Token Sale. Suppose the current Token Sale bonus is 30%. The price of the option is 5% of the total amount - $50. Investor can pay corresponding amount in any of supported currencies. The amount of GVT available with this option will be:

A GVT

1000 + 30%
1

1300 GVT

The price of each GVT will be: C GVT

1000 - 50 1300

$0.73 per token

In this example, investors are guaranteed to be able to purchase up to 1300 GVT by the price of $0.73 per token during the first day of Token Sale.

When option holder purchases GVT during the Token Sale his option (or a part of the option) is exercised: option tokens are burned and a corresponding amount of GVT is acquired.

If investors didn't exercise the option on the first day of the Token Sale, they can do it on any other day, but in this case the option will be exercised only if the Token Sale pool has enough tokens. If option holders do not exercise their options during the Token Sale, the options will be cancelled. Options can be exercised partially.

Options are non-refundable; money collected from sold options can be spent by Genesis Vision immediately on platform development and marketing.

11.Genesis Vision Token
Genesis Vision has its own token: GVT ( Genesis Vision Token). GVT is based on ERC20 Ethereum token standard. GVT will be used for all investment operations, profit distributions, and managers' token trading on the internal exchange.
All tokens will be created during the Token Sale period. The number of tokens is limited, and the subsequent issuance of tokens is technically impossible. Unsold tokens during the Token Sale are burned.
The GVT is based on the Ethereum blockchain. Its implementation corresponds to a widely distributed standard. This allows token holders to easily store and manage them using existing implementations of Ethereum wallets.
The GVT will be freely traded on crypto-exchanges.

11.1 Factors Influencing GVT Price Growth
Because the number of tokens is limited and subsequent issuance is not all allowed, the price of GVT will be determined by demand. Demand for GVT will grow due to the following factors:
All investment operations will be executed in GVT. Accordingly, increase in Genesis Vision network members' trading volume will increase demand for tokens.
The volume of the potential market supported by GVT significantly exceeds the tokens' market capitalization at the time of the Token Sale.
Genesis Vision has a well-thought-out development and marketing plan that will consistently increase the project's audience and the amount of investments.
Genesis Vision already has partners preceding its launch who will provide an active client base (our partners include 400 brokers around the world).
